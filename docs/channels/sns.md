# AWS SNS

Publishes alerts to an **Amazon SNS topic** using the AWS SDK for Go v2 with SigV4 request signing. Downstream subscribers (Lambda, SQS, email, SMS, etc.) receive the full alert as structured JSON.

## Setup

### Option 1: Static credentials (for testing or cross-account)

1. Create an IAM user with `sns:Publish` permission on the target topic.
2. Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
3. Create the channel:

```sh
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/channels -d '{
  "name": "alerts-sns",
  "type": "sns",
  "config": {
    "topic_arn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:sorobeacon",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "access_key_id": "AKIA...",
    "secret_access_key": "..."
  }
}'
```

### Option 2: Default credential chain (recommended for production)

When `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are omitted, the AWS SDK's default credential chain is used. This works with:
- EC2/ECS instance roles
- ECS task roles
- EKS pod identities (IRSA)
- Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
- Shared config/credentials files (`~/.aws/config`, `~/.aws/credentials`)
- AWS SSO

Create the channel without static credentials:

```sh
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/channels -d '{
  "name": "alerts-sns",
  "type": "sns",
  "config": {
    "topic_arn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:sorobeacon",
    "region": "us-east-1"
  }
}'
```

### IAM Policy

The identity (user or role) needs only `sns:Publish` on the topic:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sns:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:sorobeacon"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Verify:

```sh
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/channels/1/test
```

## Config

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `topic_arn` | yes | Full ARN of the SNS topic (e.g., `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:sorobeacon`). |
| `region` | yes | AWS region of the topic (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`). |
| `access_key_id` | no | Static access key. When omitted, the SDK's default credential chain is used. |
| `secret_access_key` | no | Static secret key. When omitted, the SDK's default credential chain is used. **Treated as a secret** — never logged or returned by the API. |

## Payload

Each alert is published as a JSON message to the SNS topic:

```json
{
  "monitor_id": 9,
  "monitor_name": "Token treasury",
  "rule_id": 3,
  "rule_type": "event_emitted",
  "event_id": "0000015985348674617345-0000000001",
  "contract_id": "CA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2BGMZEHXAVIRZA4KVWLTJJFC7MGXUA74P7UJUWDA",
  "event_name": "transfer",
  "ledger": 3721765,
  "tx_hash": "4f2a...",
  "payload": {"amount": "1000000000"},
  "created_at": "2026-07-21T09:41:32Z",
  "severity": "warning"
}
```

All alert fields are included so downstream subscribers can parse and route without calling back to SoroBeacon.

Non-2xx responses (returned as SDK errors) count as failures and are retried with backoff; the error carries the status code but never the secret access key.

## Credential modes

| Mode | When to use | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Static credentials** | Testing, cross-account, environments without IAM roles | Provide `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` in config. |
| **Default credential chain** | Production on AWS (EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda) | Omit static credentials; SDK resolves from instance role, env vars, config files, etc. |

Both modes use SigV4 signing automatically via the AWS SDK.

## Security

- The `secret_access_key` is **treated as a secret** — never logged, never returned by the API, never included in error messages or delivery response snippets.
- When using static credentials, store them encrypted at rest by setting `CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- Prefer the default credential chain in production to avoid managing long-lived keys.
